*Purpose*: Learning to do EDA well takes practice! In this challenge
you’ll further practice EDA by first completing a guided exploration,
then by conducting your own investigation. This challenge will also give
you a chance to use the wide variety of visual tools we’ve been
learning.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

*Background*: [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/about-gapminder/) is
an independent organization that seeks to educate people about the state
of the world. They seek to counteract the worldview constructed by a
hype-driven media cycle, and promote a “fact-based worldview” by
focusing on data. The dataset we’ll study in this challenge is from
Gapminder.

# Guided EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

First, we’ll go through a round of *guided EDA*. Try to pay attention to
the high-level process we’re going through—after this guided round
you’ll be responsible for doing another cycle of EDA on your own!

### **q0** Perform your “first checks” on the dataset. What variables are in this

dataset?

``` r
## TASK: Do your "first checks" here!
glimpse(gapminder)
```

    ## Rows: 1,704
    ## Columns: 6
    ## $ country   <fct> "Afghanistan", "Afghanistan", "Afghanistan", "Afghanistan", …
    ## $ continent <fct> Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, …
    ## $ year      <int> 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, …
    ## $ lifeExp   <dbl> 28.801, 30.332, 31.997, 34.020, 36.088, 38.438, 39.854, 40.8…
    ## $ pop       <int> 8425333, 9240934, 10267083, 11537966, 13079460, 14880372, 12…
    ## $ gdpPercap <dbl> 779.4453, 820.8530, 853.1007, 836.1971, 739.9811, 786.1134, …

**Observations**:

- Write all variable names here Country, string representing the name of
  the country Continent, string representing the continent of the
  country Year, integer representing the year the data was taken
  lifeExp, double representing the life expectancy of the country at the
  specified year pop, integer representing the population of a country
  at the specified year gdpPercap, double representing the gdp per
  capita of the country at the specified year

### **q1** Determine the most and least recent years in the `gapminder` dataset.

*Hint*: Use the `pull()` function to get a vector out of a tibble.
(Rather than the `$` notation of base R.)

``` r
## TASK: Find the largest and smallest values of `year` in `gapminder`
year_max <- gapminder %>% 
  pull(3) %>% 
  max()
year_min <- gapminder %>% 
  pull(3) %>% 
  min()
```

Use the following test to check your work.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this
assertthat::assert_that(year_max %% 7 == 5)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_max %% 3 == 0)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_min %% 7 == 6)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_min %% 3 == 2)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
if (is_tibble(year_max)) {
  print("year_max is a tibble; try using `pull()` to get a vector")
  assertthat::assert_that(False)
}

print("Nice!")
```

    ## [1] "Nice!"

### **q2** Filter on years matching `year_min`, and make a plot of the GDP per capita against continent. Choose an appropriate `geom_` to visualize the data. What observations can you make?

You may encounter difficulties in visualizing these data; if so document
your challenges and attempt to produce the most informative visual you
can.

``` r
## TASK: Create a visual of gdpPercap vs continent
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == year_min) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot(stat = "boxplot") + 
  scale_y_log10()
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q2-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- I noticed that there are a few outliers from the data, 2 in the
  Americas and 1 in Asia. I also noticed that Oceania has the highest
  GDP per capita.

**Difficulties & Approaches**:

- I initially tried a barplot of average GDP for this visualization, but
  realized it left out a lot of data. Thus, I reframed the data as a
  boxplot.

### **q3** You should have found *at least* three outliers in q2 (but possibly many more!). Identify those outliers (figure out which countries they are).

``` r
## TASK: Identify the outliers from q2
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == year_min) %>% 
  filter(continent == "Americas" | continent == "Asia") %>% 
  arrange(desc(gdpPercap))
```

    ## # A tibble: 58 × 6
    ##    country       continent  year lifeExp       pop gdpPercap
    ##    <fct>         <fct>     <int>   <dbl>     <int>     <dbl>
    ##  1 Kuwait        Asia       1952    55.6    160000   108382.
    ##  2 United States Americas   1952    68.4 157553000    13990.
    ##  3 Canada        Americas   1952    68.8  14785584    11367.
    ##  4 Bahrain       Asia       1952    50.9    120447     9867.
    ##  5 Venezuela     Americas   1952    55.1   5439568     7690.
    ##  6 Saudi Arabia  Asia       1952    39.9   4005677     6460.
    ##  7 Argentina     Americas   1952    62.5  17876956     5911.
    ##  8 Uruguay       Americas   1952    66.1   2252965     5717.
    ##  9 Cuba          Americas   1952    59.4   6007797     5587.
    ## 10 Lebanon       Asia       1952    55.9   1439529     4835.
    ## # ℹ 48 more rows

**Observations**:

- Identify the outlier countries from q2
  - Kuwait, United States, Canada

*Hint*: For the next task, it’s helpful to know a ggplot trick we’ll
learn in an upcoming exercise: You can use the `data` argument inside
any `geom_*` to modify the data that will be plotted *by that geom
only*. For instance, you can use this trick to filter a set of points to
label:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit, use ideas from this in q4 below
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == max(year)) %>%

  ggplot(aes(continent, lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = . %>% filter(country %in% c("United Kingdom", "Japan", "Zambia")),
    mapping = aes(color = country),
    size = 2
  )
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/layer-filter-1.png)<!-- -->

### **q4** Create a plot similar to yours from q2 studying both `year_min` and `year_max`. Find a way to highlight the outliers from q3 on your plot *in a way that lets you identify which country is which*. Compare the patterns between `year_min` and `year_max`.

*Hint*: We’ve learned a lot of different ways to show multiple
variables; think about using different aesthetics or facets.

``` r
## TASK: Create a visual of gdpPercap vs continent
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == year_min | year == year_max) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = gdpPercap, fill = factor(year))) +
  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(width = .8)) + 
  geom_point(data = . %>% filter(country %in% c("United States", "Canada", "Kuwait")),
    mapping = aes(color = country),
    position = position_dodge(width = .8)) + 
  scale_y_log10()
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- All the GDP per capitas increased over the years. Asia had the largest
  increase in GDP out of the continents.

# Your Own EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Now it’s your turn! We just went through guided EDA considering the GDP
per capita at two time points. You can continue looking at outliers,
consider different years, repeat the exercise with `lifeExp`, consider
the relationship between variables, or something else entirely.

### **q5** Create *at least* three new figures below. With each figure, try to pose new questions about the data.

``` r
## TASK: Your first graph
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == year_min | year == year_max) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, fill = factor(year))) +
  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(width = .8))
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task1-1.png)<!-- -->

- Median life expectancy has increased across the continents. The median
  life expectancy in Asia has gone up the most, just as in GDP per
  capita.

``` r
## TASK: Your second graph
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Europe") %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(gdp = mean(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = gdp)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task2-1.png)<!-- -->

- Average GDP per capita in Europe has increased by about \$2500 every 5
  years.

``` r
## TASK: Your third graph
gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap, fill = continent)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") 
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task3-1.png)<!-- -->

- While total GDP worldwide had increased, proportions between the
  continents has largely remained the same.
