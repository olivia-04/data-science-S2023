*Purpose*: Throughout this course, you’ll complete a large number of
*exercises* and *challenges*. Exercises are meant to introduce content
with easy-to-solve problems, while challenges are meant to make you
think more deeply about and apply the content. The challenges will start
out highly-scaffolded, and become progressively open-ended.

In this challenge, you will go through the process of exploring,
documenting, and sharing an analysis of a dataset. We will use these
skills again and again in each challenge.

*Note*: You will have seen all of these steps in `e-vis00-basics`. This
challenge is *primarily* a practice run of the submission system. The
Data Exploration part should be very simple.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

<!-- ------------------------- -->

Make sure to commit both the challenge report (`report.md` file) and
supporting files (`report_files/` folder) when you are done! Then submit
a link to Canvas. **Your Challenge submission is not complete without
all files uploaded to GitHub.**

# Data Exploration

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this first stage, you will explore the `diamonds` dataset and
document your observations.

### **q1** Create a plot of `price` vs `carat` of the `diamonds` dataset below. Document your observations from the visual.

*Hint*: We learned how to do this in `e-vis00-basics`!

``` r
## TASK: Plot `price` vs `carat` below
## Your code here!
 diamonds %>% 
  ggplot() +          
  geom_point(     
    mapping = aes( 
      x = carat,  
      y = price    
      )
    )
```

![](c00-diamonds-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q1-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- I notice that as carat increases, price generally does too which isn’t
  surprising. However, I would expect the trend of increase to be more
  linear instead of logarithmic.

### **q2** Create a visualization showing variables `carat`, `price`, and `cut` simultaneously. Experiment with which variable you assign to which aesthetic (`x`, `y`, etc.) to find an effective visual.

``` r
## TASK: Plot `price`, `carat`, and `cut` below
## Your code here!
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot() +                # 3. Adding elements to the plot
  geom_point(      # 4. Geometry
    mapping = aes( # 5. `Aes`thetic mapping
      x = price,   # 5.1. Mapping the `x` variable
      y = carat,    # 5.2. Mapping the `y` variable
      color = cut
      )
    )
```

![](c00-diamonds-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q2-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**: I noticed that cut doesn’t have a strong correlation
with price or carat, and that most cuts seem to be Ideal or Premium. \#
Communication
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this next stage, you will render your data exploration, push it to
GitHub to share with others, and link your observations within our [Data
Science
Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki).

### **q3** *Knit* your document in order to create a report.

You can do this by clicking the “Knit” button at the top of your
document in RStudio.

<figure>
<img src="./images/c00-knit.png" alt="Terminal" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Terminal</figcaption>
</figure>

This will create a local `.md` file, and RStudio will automatically open
a preview window so you can view your knitted document.

### **q4** *Push* your knitted document to GitHub.

<figure>
<img src="./images/c00-unstaged.png" alt="Terminal" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Terminal</figcaption>
</figure>

You will need to stage both the `.md` file, as well as the `_files`
folder. Note that the `_files` folder, when staged, will expand to
include all the files under that directory.

<img src="./images/c00-staged.png" alt="Terminal" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Terminal</figcaption>
</figure>

### **q5** *Submit* your work to Canvas

Navigate to your GitHub repository’s website and find the URL that
corresponds to your report. Submit this to Canvas to complete the
assignment.

### **q6** *Prepare* to present your team’s findings!

If your team is on-deck, you are responsible for putting together a
discussion of the challenge. I’ll demonstrate how to do this by leading
the discussion of Challenge 0.
