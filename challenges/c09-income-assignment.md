*Purpose*: We’ve been learning how to quantify uncertainty in estimates
through the exercises; now its time to put those skills to use studying
real data. In this challenge we’ll use concepts like confidence
intervals to help us make sense of census data.

*Reading*: - [Using ACS Estimates and Margin of
Error](https://www.census.gov/data/academy/webinars/2020/calculating-margins-of-error-acs.html)
(Optional, see the PDF on the page) - [Patterns and Causes of
Uncertainty in the American Community
Survey](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622813002518?casa_token=VddzQ1-spHMAAAAA:FTq92LXgiPVloJUVjnHs8Ma1HwvPigisAYtzfqaGbbRRwoknNq56Y2IzszmGgIGH4JAPzQN0)

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

You might wonder why the `Margin of Error` in the population estimates
is listed as `*****`. From the [documentation (PDF
link)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj81Omy16TrAhXsguAKHTzKDQEQFjABegQIBxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.census.gov%2Fprograms-surveys%2Facs%2Ftech_docs%2Faccuracy%2FMultiyearACSAccuracyofData2018.pdf%3F&usg=AOvVaw2TOrVuBDlkDI2gde6ugce_)
for the ACS:

> If the margin of error is displayed as ‘\*\*\*\*\*’ (five asterisks),
> the estimate has been controlled to be equal to a fixed value and so
> it has no sampling error. A standard error of zero should be used for
> these controlled estimates when completing calculations, such as those
> in the following section.

This means that for cases listed as `*****` the US Census Bureau
recommends treating the margin of error (and thus standard error) as
zero.

### **q2** Obtain median income data from the Census Bureau:

- `Filter > Topics > Income and Poverty > Income and Poverty`
- `Filter > Geography > County > All counties in United States`
- Look for `Median Income in the Past 12 Months` (Table S1903)
- Download the 2018 5-year ACS estimates; save to your `data` folder and
  add the filename below.

``` r
## TODO: Give the filename for your copy of Table S1903
filename_income <- "data/ACSST5Y2018.S1903-Data.csv"

## NOTE: No need to edit
df_income <-
  read_csv(filename_income, skip = 1)

Use the following test to check that you downloaded the correct file:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit, use to check you got the right file.
assertthat::assert_that(
  df_income %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001") %>%
    pull(`Estimate!!Percent Distribution!!FAMILY INCOME BY FAMILY SIZE!!2-person families`)
  == 45.6
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Well done!")
```

    ## [1] "Well done!"

This dataset is in desperate need of some *tidying*. To simplify the
task, we’ll start by considering the `\\d-person families` columns
first.

### **q3** Tidy the `df_income` dataset by completing the code below. Pivot and rename the columns to arrive at the column names `id, geographic_area_name, category, income_estimate, income_moe`.

*Hint*: You can do this in a single pivot using the `".value"` argument
and a `names_pattern` using capture groups `"()"`. Remember that you can
use an OR operator `|` in a regex to allow for multiple possibilities in
a capture group, for example `"(Estimate|Margin of Error)"`.

``` r
df_q3 <-
  df_income %>%
  select(
    Geography,
    contains("Geographic"),
    # This will select only the numeric d-person family columns;
    # it will ignore the annotation columns
    contains("median") & matches("\\d-person families") & !contains("Annotation of")
  ) %>%
  mutate(across(contains("median"), as.numeric)) %>%
## TODO: Pivot the data, rename the columns
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c(".value", "category"),
    names_pattern = "(Estimate|Margin of Error).*(\\d-person families)",
    cols = c(-Geography, -"Geographic Area Name")
  ) %>% 
  rename(
    geographic_area_name = "Geographic Area Name",
    income_estimate = "Estimate",
    income_moe = "Margin of Error"
  )
```

    ## Warning: There were 8 warnings in `mutate()`.
    ## The first warning was:
    ## ℹ In argument: `across(contains("median"), as.numeric)`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! NAs introduced by coercion
    ## ℹ Run `dplyr::last_dplyr_warnings()` to see the 7 remaining warnings.

Use the following tests to check your work:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit
assertthat::assert_that(setequal(
  names(df_q3),
  c("Geography", "geographic_area_name", "category", "income_estimate", "income_moe")
))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  df_q3 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_moe)
  == 6663
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Nice!")
```

    ## [1] "Nice!"

The data gives finite values for the Margin of Error, which is closely
related to the Standard Error. The Census Bureau documentation gives the
following relationship between Margin of Error and Standard Error:

$$\text{MOE} = 1.645 \times \text{SE}.$$

### **q4** Convert the margin of error to standard error. Additionally, compute a 99% confidence interval on income, and normalize the standard error to `income_CV = income_SE / income_estimate`. Provide these columns with the names `income_SE, income_lo, income_hi, income_CV`.

``` r
zc <- qnorm(1 - (1 - .99) / 2)

df_q4 <- 
  df_q3 %>% 
  mutate(
    income_SE = income_moe / 1.645,
    income_CV = income_SE / income_estimate,
    income_lo = income_estimate - zc * income_SE,
    income_hi = income_estimate + zc * income_SE,
  )
```

Use the following tests to check your work:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit
assertthat::assert_that(setequal(
  names(df_q4),
  c("Geography", "geographic_area_name", "category", "income_estimate", "income_moe",
    "income_SE", "income_lo", "income_hi", "income_CV")
))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_SE) - 4050.456
  ) / 4050.456 < 1e-3
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_lo) - 54513.72
  ) / 54513.72 < 1e-3
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_hi) - 75380.28
  ) / 75380.28 < 1e-3
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_CV) - 0.06236556
  ) / 0.06236556 < 1e-3
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Nice!")
```

    ## [1] "Nice!"

One last wrangling step: We need to join the two datasets so we can
compare population with income.

### **q5** Join `df_q4` and `df_pop`.

``` r
## TODO: Join df_q4 and df_pop by the appropriate column

df_data <-
  df_q4 %>% 
  left_join(x = ., y = df_pop, by = "Geography")
```

# Analysis

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

We now have both estimates and confidence intervals for
`\\d-person families`. Now we can compare cases with quantified
uncertainties: Let’s practice!

### **q6** Study the following graph, making sure to note what you can *and can’t* conclude based on the estimates and confidence intervals. Document your observations below and answer the questions.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
wid <- 0.5

df_data %>%
  filter(str_detect(geographic_area_name, "Massachusetts")) %>%
  mutate(
    county = str_remove(geographic_area_name, " County,.*$"),
    county = fct_reorder(county, income_estimate)
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(county, income_estimate, color = category)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = income_lo, ymax = income_hi),
    position = position_dodge(width = wid)
  ) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = wid)) +

  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = "County",
    y = "Median Household Income"
  )
```

    ## Warning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.
    ## ℹ In argument: `county = fct_reorder(county, income_estimate)`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! `fct_reorder()` removing 2 missing values.
    ## ℹ Use `.na_rm = TRUE` to silence this message.
    ## ℹ Use `.na_rm = FALSE` to preserve NAs.

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

![](c09-income-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q6-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Document your observations here.
  - The largest confidence interval of median household income is within
    Nantucket 5 person families.
  - Suffolk County has similar median household incomes between family
    sizes.
  - 5 and 6 person families generally have higher median incomes
- Can you confidently distinguish between household incomes in Suffolk
  county? Why or why not?
  - No, as the confidence intervals all overlap between the family sizes
- Which counties have the widest confidence intervals?
  - Nantucket, Dukes, Berkshire, and Hampshire

In the next task you’ll investigate the relationship between population
and uncertainty.

### **q7** Plot the standard error against population for all counties. Create a visual that effectively highlights the trends in the data. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

*Hint*: Remember that standard error is a function of *both* variability
(e.g. variance) and sample size.

``` r
df_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log(population_estimate), y = log(income_SE))) +
  geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 814 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

![](c09-income-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q7-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- What *overall* trend do you see between `SE` and population? Why might
  this trend exist?
  - As population gets higher, SE gets lower
- What does this *overall* trend tell you about the relative ease of
  studying small vs large counties?
  - Large counties are easier to study than small counties, as the
    former’s SE is smaller

# Going Further

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Now it’s your turn! You have income data for every county in the United
States: Pose your own question and try to answer it with the data.

### **q8** Pose your own question about the data. Create a visualization (or table) here, and document your observations.

``` r
## TODO: Pose and answer your own question about the data
df_data %>% 
  filter(str_detect(geographic_area_name, "Rhode Island")) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = income_estimate, y = geographic_area_name, fill = category), position = 'dodge')
```

![](c09-income-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q8-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Question: How do family sizes affect median income in Rhode Island?

<!-- -->

- Bristol County seems to have the highest median incomes, especially
  among 5 person families. However, the county has the most SE between
  the family sizes.
- Among all the counties, 2 person families have the lowest median
  income
- In Washington County 6 person families have the highest median income,
  which is not true for any of the other counties
- In Providence and Kent Counties, 4 person families have the highest
  median income
- In Bristol and Newport counties, 5 person families have the highest
  median income
- 2 person families have the lowest median income for all counties

Ideas:

- Compare trends across counties that are relevant to you; e.g. places
  you’ve lived, places you’ve been, places in the US that are
  interesting to you.
- In q3 we tidied the median `\\d-person families` columns only.
  - Tidy the other median columns to learn about other people groups.
  - Tidy the percentage columns to learn about how many households of
    each category are in each county.
- Your own idea!
